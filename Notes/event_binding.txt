--- Event Binding ---

1. Event Binding is one way data Binding

2. From view/template to component

3. We can call any Event
    -> event is nothing but JavaScript events like
        -> onclick
        -> onmouseover
        -> onfocus
        -> onblur

4. Syntax is

    <button (click)="method()"></button>

5. We can apply events to any element

6. If you are coming from programming
    -> functions

    f1(){

    }

7. Practice - calling events on various elements
    -> different events than I have used
    
    -> try creating few methods
        -> single parameter
        -> multiple parameter
