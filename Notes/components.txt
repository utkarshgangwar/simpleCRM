--- Angular Components ---

1. Components are the most important and basic building blocks of Angular apps.

2. Authentication Module
    - new-user
    - login
    - forgot-password
    - reset-password

3. Component is a smallest functionality that you will implement in your applicationh

4. When we group multiple Components together is becomes a module

5. We can have parent-child relationship

6. We can have components inside components

7. Tree-herirachy of components

    Dashboard
        display-contacts-list
            contact-grid                
                contact-download
                contact-export
            contact-options

8. lets create some custom components
    ng g component add-contact
    ng g component edit-contact
    ng g component list-contacts
    ng g component delete-contact

9. Every coponent has 4 files auto generated with it
    - component.html        -> view or html or template file -> UI
    - component.ts          -> it will be a class file which will have methods -> Logic
    - component.spec.ts     -> It will have the unit test script for component
    - component.sccs/css    -> stylesheet of the component

    HOMEWORK
        -> verify all the components generated and go through the code generated

10. Component decorator inside the component.ts file

    selector -> unique identifier for the component
             -> id of the component
             -> using this selector we will use the component
    templateUrl -> your HTML code
                -> component.html file
            RARE -> if small html file then,
                 -> template: `<h1>This is title</h1>`
    styleUrls -> for linking your component stylesheet
        -component.css/scss
