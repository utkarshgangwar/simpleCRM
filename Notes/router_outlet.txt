--- Router Outlet ---

1. Router outlet is a built-in directive

2. Every Angular app should have atleast 1 router outlet
    -> primary router outlet

3. By default - the router outlet is defind in app.component.html file.

4. Router outlet will match the matching routes for the components
    - takes its output
        -> insert inside the page

5. Multiple router outlets in application
    - We can have more than 1 router outlet
