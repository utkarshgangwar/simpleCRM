--- Attribute Binding ---

1. Attribute Binding is a unidirectional - one-way data Binding

2. Syntax -> [attr.attribute_name]="expression"

3. The functinality may seem almost similar to property Binding

4. One of the most important Q asked in interviews is

    -> What is the difference between property binding and attr binding

        [ngClass]="expression" // property binding

        [attr.className]="c1" // attribute binding

    -> some attribute are not natively supported for elements

        e.g -> colspan // not natively supported
                -> [colspan]="colVal" // error
                -> [attr.colspan]="colVal" // no error
    -> Angular encourages to use property binding
        -> attribute binding
