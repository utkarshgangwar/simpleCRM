--- Communication Between Various Angular Components ---

Contacts -> Module

    contact-listing -> parent component
        contact-grid -> child component
        contact-tools -> child component
            download-pdf -> sub-child component
            download-excel

Leads -> Module

Components are hierarchial
Parent-child relationship

p1
    child1
        sub-child1
    child2

p2
    p2-child1

1. Communication between the related Components
    parent component -> child component
        @Input (direcive)
    parent component <- child component
        @Output (direcive)

    Leads Module
        leads-listing
            leads-grid  
            leads-tools
                download-excel
                download-pdf

2. Communication between totally unrelated Components
    Component1 -> Services <- Component2

    Services
        is a common reusable piece of functionality shared between different Components
