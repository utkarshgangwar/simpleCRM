--- Data Binding ---

1. Each component
    <comp_name>.component.html -> vew/HTML/UI
    <comp_name>.component.css -> classNames
    <comp_name>.component.ts    -> what data to be displayed/expressions
    <comp_name>.component.spec.ts

2. Data is spread throughout these files

3. Data Binding interacting with data of the component

4. Data can be from component to template   -> one way

5. Data can be from template to component   -> one way

6. Two way -> to/from component
              from/to template

7. One way/Two way is nothing but representation of data flow

    -> one way

    -> two way
    <- two way
