--- Routing Strategy ---

1. Routing behaviour of the application's URL

2. Angular provides 2 routing strategies

    - pathLocationStrategy
        -> Default routing strategy for Angular Appls
        -> HTML 5 push state URL
        -> Examples
            - http://myapp.com/dashboard
            - http://myapp.com/user/10
            - http://myapp.com/user/10/photos 
            - http://myapp.com/seach?query=abc&state=ka&city=bangaluru


    - HashLocationStrategy
        -> URL segments/patterns
        -> URLs will have hash in the URLs
        -> Examples
            - http://myapp.com/#/dashboard
            - http://myapp.com/#/user/10
            - http://myapp.com/#/user/10/photos 
            - http://myapp.com/#/seach?query=abc&state=ka&city=bangaluru

3. Hands-on example for pathLocationStrategy
    - Default behaviour of Angular application

4. Hands-on example for HashLocationStrategy
    - we need to import HashLocationStrategy from @angular/core
    - Add it to providers array
    - Angular will start loading our URLs in Hash

5. Why do we need 2 different type of routing?

    Angular is a SPA single page application
        - index.HTML

    Cloud vendors
        AWS
        GCP
        AZURE
        Hosting Provider (Bluehost, Siteground, DigitalOcean)

    - /loans/add != folder -> route

    - index.html/#/loans/add

    404 -> index.html -> /loans/add without #

6. Which one you should use when?

    Really there is no difference affect your application

    pathLocationStrategy
        -> Clean URLs
        -> Simple
        -> Bookmarkable
        -> Easy to remember
